#Question 1
#Under the lattice graphics system, what do the primary plotting functions like xyplot() and bwplot() return?
an object of class "trellis"

#Question 2
#What is produced by the following code?
	library(nlme)
	library(lattice)
	xyplot(weight ~ Time | Diet, BodyWeight)
A set of 3 panels showing the relationship between weight and time for each diet.

#Question 3
#Annotation of plots in any plotting system involves adding points, lines, or text to the plot, in addition to customizing 
#axis labels or adding titles. Different plotting systems have different sets of functions for annotating plots in this way. 
#Which of the following functions can be used to annotate the panels in a multi-panel lattice plot?
panel.lmline()

#Question 4
#The following code does NOT result in a plot appearing on the screen device.
	library(lattice)
	library(datasets)
	data(airquality)
	p <- xyplot(Ozone ~ Wind | factor(Month), data = airquality)
#Which of the following is an explanation for why no plot appears?
The object 'p' has not yet been printed with the appropriate print method.

#Question 5
#In the lattice system, which of the following functions can be used to finely control the appearance of all lattice plots?
trellis.par.set()

#Question 6
#What is ggplot2 an implementation of?
the Grammar of Graphics developed by Leland Wilkinson

#Question 7
#Load the airquality dataset form the datasets package in R.
	library(datasets)
	data(airquality)
#I am interested in examining how the relationship between ozone and wind speed varies across each month. What would be the 
#appropriate code to visualize that using ggplot2? 
library(ggplot2)
airquality = transform(airquality, Month = factor(Month))
qplot(Wind, Ozone, data = airquality, facets = . ~ Month)

#Question 8
#What is a geom in the ggplot2 system?
a plotting object like point, line, or other shape

#Question 9
#When I run the following code I get an error:
	library(ggplot2)
	g <- ggplot(movies, aes(votes, rating))
	print(g)
#I was expecting a scatterplot of 'votes' and 'rating' to appear. What's the problem?	
ggplot does not yet know what type of layer to add to the plot.
	
#Question 10
#The following code creates a scatterplot of 'votes' and 'rating' from the movies dataset in the ggplot2 package. 
#After loading the ggplot2 package with the library() function, I can run
	qplot(votes, rating, data = movies)
#How can I modify the the code above to add a smoother to the scatterplot?
qplot(votes, rating, data = movies) + geom_smooth()
